# Project Name
> This case study is to understand 
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Essentially, the company wants â€”
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.

## Conclusions
The equation of our best fitted line is:
- cnt = 0.2331 * yr  +  0.0515 * workingday  +  0.6022 * temp  -  0.1388 * windspeed  +  0.1052 * Winter + 0.0617 * Sat  -  0.2546 * Light Rain  +  0.0531

The variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes are
- temp
- yr
- Winter

The demand of the bike increases by
- 0.6022 times with increase in 1 uint of tempereature provided all other variables remain constant
- 0.2331 times with increase in 1 year provided all other variables remain constant
